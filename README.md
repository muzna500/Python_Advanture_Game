#  Adventure Game (Python)

An interactive **text-based adventure game** written in Python where the player explores a mysterious world, faces random villains, and makes choices that determine their fate.

##  Game Overview
In this game, you find yourself in an open field with two options — a **house** and a **cave**.  
Rumor has it that a dangerous villain is lurking nearby. Will you find the magical sword and defeat them, or fall in battle with your tiny dagger?

Each game session offers a different experience as the villain is randomly chosen.

## Features
- 🎲 Random villain selection each playthrough  
- 🏠 Interactive choices (fight, explore, or flee)  
- ⚔️ Hidden item discovery (Sword of Ogoroth)  
- 🔁 Option to replay after finishing  
- 💤 Smooth pacing using timed messages with `time.sleep()`  

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
  - `time` – to create short delays for better user experience  
  - `random` – to choose random villains

## Sample Gameplay

You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass and yellow wildflowers.

Rumor has it that a dragon is somewhere around here, and has been terrifying the nearby village.

In front of you is a house.

To your right is a dark cave.

In your hand, you hold your trusty (but not very effective) dagger.

Enter 1 to knock on the door of the house.

Enter 2 to peer into the cave.
